# Weather App - Weathr
In this project, I created a simple weather app using the OpenWeather API. On page load, it fetches weather data based on user's current location and displays it on the page. Users can use the search form to find the weather of city they are interested in.

It is necessary to follow the guidelines in the "Tips" section. Otherwise, you'll be notified of errors.
